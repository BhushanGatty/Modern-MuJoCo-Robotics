# Modern MuJoCo Robotics (2025)

A collection of robotics algorithms (Kinematics, Dynamics, Control) based on Pranav Bhounsule's bootcamp, fully refactored and modernized for the new DeepMind `mujoco` Python bindings.

## The Project
The original course uses the deprecated `mujoco-py` wrapper which no longer works on modern Linux systems. This repository contains the **modernized translations** of those algorithms using the native DeepMind API.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Physics Engine:** DeepMind MuJoCo (2.x/3.x)
* **IDE:** VS Code (Linux)

## Examples Included
* **Projectile Motion:** Basic physics and drag simulation.
* **2-Link Manipulator:** Double pendulum dynamics and chaotic motion.
